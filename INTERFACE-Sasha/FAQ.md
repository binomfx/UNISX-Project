# FAQ
## SPAC
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”) are companies formed to raise capital in an initial public offering (“IPO”) with the purpose of using the proceeds to acquire one or more unspecified businesses or assets to be identified after the IPO (irrespective of form, a “Business Combination”). 
SPACs have only a limited period during which they may consummate a Business Combination, generally not exceeding 24 months. 
A SPAC generally focuses upon one industry or sector, but may maintain flexibility to engage in transactions in other industries or sectors if necessary or appropriate.<br>
More information about SPACs can be found [here](https://spac.guide/spacbasics/) and [here](https://www.spacanalytics.com/).<br>

## Syntetic token
By their nature, SPAC shares are subject to impulsive growth at the moment of information or even just rumors that a target company for a merger has been found.<br>
`A good way to capitalize on such momentum growth without having to analyze hundreds of SPACs is to take advantage of the movement of the index value that includes stocks of the most active SPACs.`<br>
The price of our synthetic tokens is tied to the value of the SPAC stock index.
